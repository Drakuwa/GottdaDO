GottaDO
=======

**GottaDO** is a simple and easy to use, TODO list application where you can easily 
organize your everyday life and let us do the remembering for you. Add a task, set a 
due date, or a higher priority if you like, and GottaDO will remind you when the 
time comes. You can filter the list by priority, see the unfinished tasks, or the ones 
that you have completed, or just show the task that are due today. Search through the 
list and sort the results by priority, or due date, and delete all the expired or 
completed tasks when you want, all with a simple select from the application menu.
GottaDO also has a home screen quick add task widget that might come in handy.
Hope you have fun, and find a good use for GottaDO.
